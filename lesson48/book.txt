Lesson 36
A wet night in Paris
巴黎的一个雨夜

It was a wet night. The rain was falling fast, but the streets were full of people. Paris is never more lively than on a wet night. We walked through the streets, happy to be together.
这是一个湿漉漉的夜晚。雨下得很大，但街上挤满了人。巴黎在湿漉漉的夜晚总是格外热闹。我们走过街头，为能够在一起而感到快乐。

We were on our way to the station. We were going to the South of France. We had been looking forward to our holiday for a long time and it was wonderful to be on our way at last.
我们正在去车站的路上。我们要去法国南部。我们已经期盼着度假很长时间了，终于能够出发真是太美妙了。

As we walked through the streets, the rain beat against our faces. My wife was carrying the tickets in her hand. Suddenly she stopped and looked at me.
当我们走过街头时，雨点砸在我们的脸上。我妻子手里拿着车票。突然间，她停住了，看着我。

"What's the matter?" I asked.
“怎么了？”我问。

"I've left the tickets behind," she said.
“我把车票落在家里了，”她说。

We went back at once. There was not a taxi in sight. It was useless to look for one.
我们马上回去。四下里找不到出租车。找也是找不到的。

It took us more than half an hour to get back to our flat. We were wet through and through. My wife went into the bedroom to look for the tickets. She soon came back with them in her hand.
我们花了一个多半小时才回到家。我们全身湿透了。我妻子进卧室找车票。她很快就拿着车票回来了。

"I put them in a drawer," she said. "I didn't want to forget them, so I put them in the drawer with the spoons."
“我把它们放在抽屉里了，”她说。“我不想忘了它们，所以把它们和调羹一起放在抽屉里了。”

We called a taxi and went to the station. We got there just in time. The train was ready to leave. It was going to be a wonderful holiday after all.
我们叫了一辆出租车，去了车站。我们赶到的正好，火车准备开了。这个度假终究是美好的。
